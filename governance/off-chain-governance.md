# Off-Chain Governance

{% hint style="info" %}
Since subDAOs can arbitrarily set up their own forms of internal off-chain governance, this article will restrict itself to the available off-chain, community-driven forms of governance within Maker Core.
{% endhint %}

Off-chain governance is a form of governance that does not require any token nor interaction with a blockchain from its participants. Hence it increases the pool of people able to participate in improving the protocol. Off-chain governance takes the form of a free, unconstrained exchange of ideas, and it can be used as a way of gathering feedback to support and inform prospective on-chain governance.

These exchanges and the possibility of initiating them are free for all. They can be conducted in several venues:

- In the [MakerDAO forum](forum.makerdao.com/), usually under the [Ecosystem Discussion category](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/ecosystem-discussions/89).
	- The MakerDAO forum also allows for the creation of polls, which can be used to gauge community sentiment and to stir further, deeper discussion.
- In the [MakerDAO Discord server](https://discord.gg/RBRumCpEDH), in which many topical channels are available.

When engaging in off-chain governance, it is important to prioritize courtesy and common sense. MakerDAO encourages respectful and inclusive discussions, and constructive feedback.

While less direct than on-chain governance, the power of the free exchange of ideas should not be underestimated and can have large consequences for the protocol.
