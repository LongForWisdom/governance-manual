# Writing Guide

This guide intends to inform authors of the most effective way to write for the Maker Operational Manual, and other documentation.

## User Needs

### Identifying Needs

Everything we publish should meet a user need. A user need is what somebody wants to achieve when they visit our documentation. Ideally, this should be based on evidence and not assumption. 

It can be easy to make assumptions about users that may be wrong. Users will have different levels of knowledge and education, backgrounds and needs from our documentation.

To help define your users’ needs, put yourself in the position of the user. Ask yourself who they are, what they need, and why they need it. This will improve your understanding of what they want or need to achieve when visiting our documentation.

When writing and structuring documentation, think about how a user need could be met. Try not to include a solution when defining your user need. It can prevent you from finding a better way of meeting the user need. 

### Meeting Needs

Users want to be able to find the information they need as quickly as possible.

You should prioritise the most important things your users need to know by using the inverted pyramid structure.

People do not usually read content unless they are looking for information, so if what you have written does not meet the user need, you can probably leave it out. You do not need to tell them everything or overwhelm them with information.

## Structuring Content

**Place information in order of importance to the user.**

The most important information in our documentation must be at the start – this is called frontloading. 

We use the inverted pyramid to achieve this, placing information in order of importance on the page. This is the best practice style when writing documentation. 

The main information of the content – who, why, what, where, when and how – appears in the first paragraphs so that most users will see it.  

The inverted pyramid structure is: 

1. most important information  
2. important details 
3. other general or background information 

### Paragraphs and Sentences

As with the overall structure, each paragraph and sentence should be frontloaded with the most important information at the start. 

When writing documentation, your paragraphs should: 

* have no more than four sentences that follow a logical order 
* begin with the most important information for that paragraph, meaning readers can skim through the information 
* make complete sense on their own 
* cover one subject 

Individual sentences should be no longer than 25 words. If they are any longer, they may need to be divided into two. 

## Plain English

Everything we publish should be in plain English. This means using clear language that all readers can understand.

Research shows that most people prefer sentences written in plain English. This includes expert users with a high level of specialist knowledge. The more complex the issue, the greater the preference for plain language.

### Be concise
* limit each paragraph to four short sentences
* stick to one idea or theme per paragraph
* avoid complicated sentence structures
* break up large blocks of text with subheadings


### Write simply

Do not use formal or long words when easy or short words will do. If you cannot avoid technical terms, explain them in the text or on a glossary page. You should also ensure that any acronyms or abbreviations are written out in full for the first use in each section.

### Use the active voice
Always use the active voice, not the passive. This is when the subject of the sentence is doing something, rather than having something done to them.

The active voice makes sentences shorter and clearer.

### Be clear
Sentences that can be read in several different ways may be misleading.

Make sure that there is no ambiguity in your writing, and that your meaning is clear.

**Bad**
“Taylor worked on the development stage of the project and is now part of the policy group with responsibility for legislation.”

The sentence reads as though the policy group is responsible for legislation. In fact, it is Taylor.

**Good**
“Taylor worked on the development stage of the project and is now part of the policy group, where she has responsibility for legislation.”

### Editing tools

[Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) is an online tool that gives your writing a readability grade. It will report on its complexity and make suggestions for improvements. Aim for grade 9.
