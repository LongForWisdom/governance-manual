# MIP65 - Monetalis Clydesdale

MIP65 established a legal structure that borrows DAI from a vault, exchanges it for USDC in the PSM and then cashes out the USDC to USD. These funds are then invested in a mixture of short-term US bonds. The end result is US treasuries backing DAI.

The end assets are IB01 and IBTA ETFs.

The DAI loan is collateralized 1:1 with US Treasuries, although the true collateralization ratio may vary with the value of the underlying holdings.

On a quarterly basis, surplus treasuries are sold and the excess returned to the Surplus Buffer, marking profits for MakerDAO and MKR holders.
