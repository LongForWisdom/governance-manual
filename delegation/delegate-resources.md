## Voting and the Governance System

Information about the major parameters that exist within the Maker Protocol can be found as part of the Maker Operational Manaual Parameter Index.

The [Executive Transation]() page shows you how to check that your voting transactions match the Voting Portal UI.

The [Executive Audit]() page describes a non-exhaustive set of items that are important to check when looking at executive spell code. 

Technical documentation for the Maker Protocol executive governance system is located [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/chief-detailed-documentation). Important concepts for delegates to understand about the Maker Protocol governance system include: 
* [Spells](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/spell-detailed-documentation#3.-key-mechanisms-and-concepts) and their [failure modes](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/spell-detailed-documentation#5.-failure-modes-bounds-on-operating-conditions-and-external-risk-factors).
* [Slates](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/chief-detailed-documentation#glossary-chief)
* The ['hat'](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/chief-detailed-documentation#4.-gotchas-potential-source-of-user-error)
* [Approval Voting](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/chief-detailed-documentation#approval-voting)
* [Key Failure Modes](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/chief-detailed-documentation#5.-failure-modes-bounds-on-operating-conditions-and-external-risk-factors)
* The [Pause](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/pause-detailed-documentation) contract

Concretely, it is important that delegates act to ensure that amount of MKR on the `hat` remains as high as possible for as long as possible when voting for new executive spells. This can be achieved by voting for both the current and next executive using the official voting portal.
